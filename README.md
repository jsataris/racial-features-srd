# Racial Features (SRD) compendium

An implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Racial Traits and Features from the Systems Reference Document (SRD). 

This module is distributed under the Open Gaming License v1.0a.
The [Systems Reference Document (SRD)](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) for included
content is available in full from Wizards of the Coast.

## Installation Instructions

To install the D&D5E system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, simply paste the following URL into the **Install System**

If you wish to manually install the system, you must clone or extract it into the ``Data/modules/`` folder. You

## This is a Work in Progress

I built this compendium with the intention of having it included in the core D&D5E system on FoundryVTT. As such, content is subject to change as style guides are finalized and disseminated to module developers. I intend on removing several of the racial features, such as size/speed, once a Racial "class" is implemented in the core D&D5E system. 

## Only SRD Content

In keeping with the design philosophy of the FoundryVTT platform I will not include any content that is not found in the SRD.
